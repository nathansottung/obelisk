# Install it and take the first run

Obelisk is a **single program** — one file. There is nothing to install in the
usual sense, no setup wizard, and no account to create. You download it, run it,
and it opens a page in your web browser.

This guide gets you from "nothing" to "the app is open and ready."

## 1. Download the right file for your computer

1. Go to the project's **Releases** page (the download page on its code site).
2. Download the file that matches your computer:
   - **Windows** — the file ending in `.exe` (for example `obelisk.exe`).
   - **Mac** — the file with `macos` in its name.
   - **Linux** — the file with `linux` in its name.

You should now have one downloaded file. Put it somewhere you can find it, like a
new folder called `Obelisk` in your Documents.

## 2. Run it

Running it starts a small **local web server** — a program on your own computer
that serves a web page only to you. Nothing is exposed to the internet.

On the first launch only, explicitly create the configuration: on Windows,
open PowerShell in the program folder and run `.\obelisk.exe -init-config`;
on Mac/Linux, append `-init-config` to the command for your downloaded binary.
After that first launch, use the normal commands below. A missing configuration
on an existing installation can mean disconnected storage: restore access to
the saved settings instead of initializing a replacement. Damaged existing
settings are refused even with `-init-config`.

- **Windows:** double-click `obelisk.exe`. If Windows shows a blue "Windows
  protected your PC" box (because the file is new and unsigned), click **More
  info → Run anyway**. You should now see a small black window with a line like:
  `Obelisk <version> — http://127.0.0.1:7821`. Leave that window open — it *is* the
  app. Closing it stops the app.
- **Mac / Linux:** it is usually easiest to run it from the **Terminal** (the text
  window where you type commands — on Mac, open the app called "Terminal"). Type
  the path to the file and press Enter. You should see the same
  `http://127.0.0.1:7821` line. (On Mac you may first need to allow it in **System
  Settings → Privacy & Security**.)

That web address — `http://127.0.0.1:7821` — always means "this same computer."
`127.0.0.1` is the standard address a computer uses to talk to itself.

### If you run Docker or Compose

Use the image built from this corrected source checkout, not an older release
that may lack this initialization behavior. From the checkout directory:

```bash
docker build -t ghcr.io/nathansottung/obelisk:latest .
```

Put your long random token in a private `.env` file as `OBELISK_AUTH_TOKEN=` followed
by the token; keep it out of version control. Choose ONE storage mapping below.
First-use publication requires a filesystem supporting hard links; unsupported
storage is refused without replacing anything.

For **Docker run**, initialize the same named volumes that normal startup will use:

```bash
docker run --rm --name obelisk-init --pull never --env-file .env \
  -v mnemo-data:/data -v mnemo-staging:/staging \
  ghcr.io/nathansottung/obelisk:latest \
  -listen 127.0.0.1:7821 -data /data -init-config
```

Initialization keeps serving. This bootstrap publishes no ports and binds to
container loopback. After the ready message, run `docker stop obelisk-init` from
another terminal and wait for the foreground command to return. Then run normally:

```bash
docker run -d --name obelisk --pull never --env-file .env -p 7821:7821 \
  -v mnemo-data:/data -v mnemo-staging:/staging \
  ghcr.io/nathansottung/obelisk:latest \
  -listen 0.0.0.0:7821 -data /data
```

For **Compose**, use the repository's `docker-compose.yml` and its `obelisk` service.
Adjust its example read-only source mounts to your actual datasets first. Keep
using the same project directory and `.env`; `/data` is bound to `./data`, not to
the named volume in the Docker-run example. Before the first `up`, bootstrap with:

```bash
docker compose run --rm --no-deps --pull never --name obelisk-init obelisk \
  -listen 127.0.0.1:7821 -data /data -init-config
```

Do not add `--service-ports`: this one-off launch publishes no ports. `--rm`
overrides the service restart policy for bootstrap. After the ready message, run
`docker stop obelisk-init` in another terminal, wait for the foreground command to
return, then start the normal service:

```bash
docker compose up -d --pull never --no-build obelisk
```

Both routes keep the data volume/bind mount. The normal command omits
`-init-config`; never add it permanently to CMD, Compose commands or restart
scripts. A CMD override replaces ALL arguments, so supply the full data/listen
arguments shown above. For normal service access use the container host's address
on port 7821 and the token from `.env`.

Missing or damaged settings on an existing installation require reconnecting or
restoring the original configuration. Deliberate defaults alongside existing
catalog/key state do not recover the original auth token, helper paths, keystore
paths or staging choices. Choosing defaults is a separate setup decision, not a
recovery shortcut. Do not remove the data volume to work around an error.

## 3. Open the page

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari).
2. In the address bar, type `http://127.0.0.1:7821` and press Enter.

You should now see the Obelisk page: a column of tabs on the left (Home, Vault,
Protection, and more) and, because nothing is set up yet, a **"Getting started"**
checklist in the middle.

## 4. Install the three helper tools

Obelisk leans on three small, free, standard tools to do its work. They are the
same tools that make your backups restorable by hand later, so they matter:

- **tar** — bundles many files into one file.
- **gpg** — encrypts (scrambles) packages, if you choose encryption.
- **par2** — creates repair data that can fix limited damage.

Look at the small **status lamp** at the bottom of the left-hand tabs. If it says
**"setup needed — see Settings,"** one or more tools are missing. Click the
**Settings** tab. At the top you'll see each tool with **found** or **missing**,
and a short hint for how to install the missing ones on your system:

- **Windows:** `tar` already comes with Windows 10 and newer. Install **gpg** with
  Gpg4win (from gpg4win.org). Install **par2** with a package manager like
  Chocolatey (`choco install par2cmdline`).
- **Mac:** use Homebrew — `brew install gnupg par2` (tar is already there).
- **Linux:** use your package manager — for example `apt install gnupg par2`.

After installing a tool, return to Settings. You should now see it change to
**found**. When all three say **found**, the status lamp turns to
**"tar · gpg · par2 · keys ready."**

## 5. Follow the Getting Started checklist

Go back to the **Home** tab. The **Getting started** checklist has seven steps and
each one detects its own state and turns green when done:

1. Install the three tools *(you just did this)*.
2. Set a staging folder *(a scratch work folder — see [Set up safely](02-set-up-safely.md))*.
3. Register 2 keystores *(only needed if you want encryption)*.
4. Create your first archive.
5. Scan a folder into it.
6. Plan and build a package.
7. Write a verified copy.

Each step has a button that jumps you to the exact spot. You can do them in order.
The rest of this handbook walks through them.

## How to know it worked

- The black window (or Terminal) shows a line with `http://127.0.0.1:7821`.
- The browser page loads and shows the tabs on the left.
- After installing the tools, the status lamp reads **"tar · gpg · par2 · keys
  ready."**

## If something went wrong

- **The browser says it can't connect.** The app isn't running, or you typed the
  address wrong. Make sure the black window/Terminal is still open and shows the
  address, then re-type `http://127.0.0.1:7821` exactly.
- **The page loads but the lamp says "setup needed."** One of tar/gpg/par2 isn't
  installed yet. Open Settings and follow the install hint for whichever shows
  **missing**.
- **The very first time you open Settings it feels slow, then is fine.** That's
  normal — the app is checking your tools for the first time. It is fast
  afterward.
- **Windows blocked the file.** Click **More info → Run anyway** on the blue box.
  The file is safe; it is just new and unsigned.
- Still stuck? See **[troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)**.
