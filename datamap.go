// datamap.go — pure honesty surfacing. It answers, in one place and in plain terms,
// "where does this tool put things, and what does it promise never to touch?" Nothing
// here changes behavior; it only reports paths and invariants that already hold:
//
//   - everything Obelisk WRITES (catalog + daily backups, config, keystores, staging,
//     the destinations you pick, the small inventory/seal sidecars it puts ONLY on media
//     it writes itself, and the reversible "_deleted" quarantine folders); and
//   - everything it NEVER writes to (your source folders, drives you adopt), with the one
//     enforcement sentence and a pointer to the tests that prove it.
//
// The paths are computed from the same config the rest of the app reads, so the screen
// can never drift from reality.
